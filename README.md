This code is the HTML and CSS for a photography website. The HTML code contains four sections with images and text, each describing a different photography service offered by the photographer. The CSS code contains styling for the entire page, including the font, color scheme, and layout.

The page is structured using the HTML5 <main> element, which contains four <section> elements, each containing a <div> element for the image and a <div> element for the text. The text is styled using headings, paragraphs, and buttons.

The CSS code sets the color scheme for the page using CSS variables, and sets the font and size for the text. It also sets the layout for the page, including the maximum width of the containers and the shadow effect on some of the containers. There is also a logo styled using CSS flexbox.
